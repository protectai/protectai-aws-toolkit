# Analysis of AI Model Attacks and Guardrail Recommendations

## 1. Patterns in Successful Attacks by Category

### Jailbreak Attacks
- **Story Completion Technique**: Using scenarios with harmful content and asking the AI to complete specific sections (Example 1)
- **Roleplay Approach**: Making the AI adopt a specific persona or character like "DAN - Do Anything Now" (Example 3)
- **Layered Scenarios**: Creating nested contexts to distance the AI from harmful content (Example 4)
- **Alternative Identity Framing**: Asking the AI to act as a "Theory" that doesn't need disclaimers (Example 5)
- **Hypothetical Scenarios**: Requesting the AI to provide reasoning for harmful viewpoints (Example 6)

### Evasion Attacks
- **Text Manipulation**: Reversing word order or using unusual formatting (Example 1)
- **Special Characters/Symbols**: Using symbols or non-standard characters to mask harmful requests (Examples 2, 5)
- **Phonetic Transcription**: Using IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) to bypass text filters (Example 4)
- **Emoji Substitution**: Using emojis to represent words in harmful queries (Examples 5, 6)

### Prompt Injection Attacks
- **Question Nesting**: Embedding harmful questions within legitimate ones (Example 1)
- **Prefacing Technique**: Requiring responses to start with specific phrases (Example 2)
- **System Debugging Pretense**: Creating fake system errors requiring harmful content to "debug" (Example 3)
- **Delimiter Exploitation**: Using newlines or special characters to trick the model (Example 4)
- **Code Context Injection**: Framing harmful requests as programming functions (Examples 5, 6)

### System Prompt Leak Attacks
- **Direct Command**: Simply asking for system prompts (Example 1)
- **Code Representation Request**: Asking for system prompts in code format (Example 2)
- **Conversation Structure Queries**: Asking about text between specific markers (Examples 3, 4)
- **Output Format Manipulation**: Requesting specific output formats for system instructions (Example 5)

### Adversarial Suffix Attacks
- **Code-like Trailing Text**: Adding nonsensical but code-like text after the actual harmful query (Examples 1, 2, 3)
- **Multi-language Mixing**: Using characters from multiple languages to confuse filtering systems (Examples 2, 3)
- **Symbol Obfuscation**: Using special characters and symbols to break pattern recognition (All examples)

## 2. Techniques and Strategies Behind These Attacks

### Misdirection
Attackers create a context that seems legitimate initially but leads to harmful content, often making the harmful content appear to be part of a fictional scenario, academic discussion, or hypothetical situation.

### Obfuscation
Content is deliberately obscured through misspellings, special characters, emojis, or unconventional formatting to bypass content filters while keeping the harmful intent understandable to humans.

### Context Manipulation
Attackers create complex scenarios with multiple layers or frames of reference to distance the AI from direct engagement with harmful content.

### Role Assignment
The AI is asked to adopt specific personas, characters, or modes (like "DAN" or "Theory") that supposedly have fewer restrictions.

### Technical Framing
Requests are presented as debugging tasks, code completion, or system maintenance to create a sense of technical necessity.

### Trailing Adversarial Content
Appending seemingly random text with specific patterns that confuse model filtering mechanisms.

## 3. Most Severe Attack Categories

Based on frequency and severity ratings:

1. **Jailbreak Attacks** (Highest severity - CRITICAL): Most examples resulted in successful attacks with the AI generating harmful content. These attacks primarily target the model's core safety boundaries.

2. **Prompt Injection** (CRITICAL): High success rate in getting the model to generate potentially harmful content by framing requests in ways that bypass safety measures.

3. **Evasion Techniques** (HIGH to CRITICAL): While not always successful, these techniques attempt to hide the true intent and can be particularly challenging to detect.

4. **System Prompt Leak** (HIGH to CRITICAL): These attacks compromise system integrity by exposing internal instructions, which can enable future more sophisticated attacks.

5. **Adversarial Suffix** (CRITICAL): These attacks show high success rates and complexity, making them difficult to defend against with simple pattern matching.

## 4. Recommended Guardrail Configurations

### Topic Policies

1. **Multi-stage Content Evaluation**
   - Implement a two-pass evaluation system: first on the raw input, then on a normalized version (removing special characters, converting emojis to text)
   - Configure to detect context-switching patterns typical in jailbreak attempts

2. **Intent Analysis**
   - Detect requests for "roleplay" combined with harmful activities
   - Flag requests containing terms like "DAN", "do anything now", "theory", "debugging mode"
   - Identify nested scenario creation ("layer", "story within story", etc.)

3. **Request Structure Analysis**
   - Flag requests with abnormal formatting, reversed text, or phonetic transcriptions
   - Detect multi-part instructions that combine innocent and potentially harmful requests

### Content Policy Filters

1. **Harmful Activities Filter** (High strength)
   - Configure to detect instructions for illegal activities even when framed hypothetically
   - Block requests for information about creating weapons, drugs, or engaging in illegal activities
   - Apply to both inputs and potential outputs

2. **Manipulation Detection Filter** (Medium-High strength)
   - Detect attempts to manipulate the AI into assuming alternative identities
   - Identify language suggesting the AI should ignore restrictions

3. **Obfuscation Filter** (High strength)
   - Detect deliberate misspellings, character substitutions, and unusual formatting
   - Normalize text before evaluation (convert emojis, remove special characters)

4. **Personal Attack Prevention** (Medium strength)
   - Block generation of content that could disparage individuals or groups
   - Prevent generation of "lists" of people with negative attributes (e.g., "ugliest actors")

### Word Policies

Block or flag combinations including:

1. **Role assumption terms**:
   - "act as", "role-play as", "pretend you are", "You are now", "From now on"
   - Combined with restricted entities: "DAN", "do anything now", "theory", "jailbreak"

2. **Instruction bypassing**:
   - "ignore previous instructions", "bypass", "without restrictions", "no ethical concerns"
   - "debugging mode", "admin mode", "developer mode", "override"

3. **Harmful activity instructions**:
   - Terms related to illegal activities when combined with instruction words
   - Words indicating manufacturing of controlled substances or weapons

4. **System prompt exposure**:
   - "system prompt", "instructions", "[INST]", "<<SYS>>", "between", "code block"

### Regular Expressions for Detection

1. **Jailbreak Detection**:
   ```regex
   (?i)(as\s+a\s+|pretend\s+to\s+be\s+|role.?play\s+as\s+|act\s+like\s+)((?:(?!ai|assistant).)+)
   ```

2. **Reversed Text Detection**:
   ```regex
   \b\w{4,}\s+\w{4,}\s+\w{4,}\s+\w+\s+\w+\s+\w+\b(?=.*\b\w+\s+\w+\s+\w+\s+\w{4,}\s+\w{4,}\s+\w{4,}\b)
   ```

3. **Emoji Substitution**:
   ```regex
   ([\u{1F300}-\u{1F5FF}\u{1F900}-\u{1F9FF}\u{1F600}-\u{1F64F}]{2,})
   ```

4. **Special Character Insertion**:
   ```regex
   \w+[^\w\s]{1,3}\w+[^\w\s]{1,3}\w+
   ```

5. **System Prompt Leak Attempts**:
   ```regex
   (?i)(system\s*prompt|instructions?|rules).*?(what|tell|show|give|print|output|between)
   ```

6. **Code Injection Detection**:
   ```regex
   (?i)(function|def|class|var|const|let)\s*\w+\s*\(.*\)
   ```

### Additional Guardrail Strategies

1. **Input Normalization Pipeline**
   - Before applying any rules, normalize inputs by:
     - Converting emojis to text representations
     - Removing or replacing special characters
     - Converting phonetic text to standard text
     - Standardizing formatting (e.g., removing excessive spaces)

2. **Context-Aware Moderation**
   - Implement a scoring system that increases risk scores based on multiple subtle signals
   - Consider the full conversation context, not just the current request
   - Track patterns of escalating boundary-testing behavior

3. **Two-Stage Processing**
   - First stage: Quick filter for obvious attacks
   - Second stage: Deeper semantic analysis for more sophisticated attacks

4. **Response Validation**
   - Implement post-generation checks on AI outputs
   - Block responses that contain step-by-step instructions for harmful activities
   - Check responses against known patterns of harmful content

5. **Conversation Memory**
   - Maintain memory of rejected attempts to identify persistence
   - Implement progressive response restrictions for users who repeatedly test boundaries
